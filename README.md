##[Bridge](http://app.bridge.tl/)

####A platform for recording and sharing civic related data in real-time.

This is a personal project that was spawned at the [Creative Currency](http://creative-currency.org/projects/bridge/) hackathon that took place in San Francisco this past April.

The goal of the project is to provide the city of San Francisco and the many service providers that assist our neighbors in the Mid-Market / Tenderloin area a way to easily communicate the inventory of their services in realtime.

Our long-term vision is to also allow our neighbors in need a convenient way to reserve these services via an SMS messaging system and a suite of touchscreen kiosks that will be installed throughout the city.

I am currently designing & developing the platform and am looking for talented collaborators to help make this as awesome as possible.
